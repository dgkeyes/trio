Responses The topic wasn’t covered in depth relative to the content. (Surface skimmed) I didn’t feel like there was a real explanation in the difference of programs. You could tell that some people were just reading straight from a script, which wasn’t very dynamic or engaging. Would have liked a bit more than the text on the slides. For example, applying some of the requirements to specific TRIO case studies. I believe there is still growth possible in those areas. Continual reinforcement is key. Presenter’s style wasn’t inviting. It is so much information, I just feel I would need several more training sessions to feel comfortable with all of it I felt the IT one was very long and didn’t always pertain to what I was doing it wasn’t the information per se, the speaker didn’t sound as clear as the others. 5.3 To what extent were your general expectations of the training met? Responses To become more familiar with the TRIO regulations. they were met I feel that the training met my expectatons. To have a better understanding of management of the TRiO budget very informative. Lots of information to understand. By day 3 I felt a better understanding of acronyms used. To the highest extent The training was more detailed than I expected. Gaining a better understanding of TRIO budget management Well beyond what I expected! I figured the information would be provided, but expected it to be boring yes, very helpful! a good extent I had some understanding of this already It was met - I received the information I had hoped to during the training. The training covered everything I expected it to cover. Exceeded my expectations. Great Information Above expected To be introduced to topics I wasn’t informed on prior to this training. All my expectations were met. Exceeded my expectations Fully met my expectations Expectations were met by providing a thorough overview of the program and resources available I expected a brief overview. Needed overview of budget management and received it They were met I learned a lot about budgeting and what is and what isn’t allowed Amazing! I really learned a lot! The majority of my expectations were met. This training is needed to all those new to TRIO upon hire! This is really the “meat and gravy” of the projects. Overall, the training exceeded my expectations. I gained information on internal controls and IT controls. 5.4 Please mention three (3) main take aways from the overall training Responses Documentation is key. 2. Consistency 3. Always follow internal control procedures. Although there is a lot of material that was covered, I really appreciated that the training referenced where to find the information related to regulations and legislation. It was helpful that each of the TRIO programs were covered since they vary in allowable costs, etc. Federal vs. institution policies/regulations. Importance of budget and spending associated with program objectives. Maintaining checks and balances in budget. Internal control mechanisms, OMB importance, Legislation An accounting background would have been helpful for some of the content. I found I already knew much of the information. Legislation &amp; regulations refresher, effective budget management, and effective IT controls Using OMB, COSO, VUB specific regulations what is allowed, what isn’t allowed and where to find answers to questions creating a “Bridge Report” for linking Dept of Ed budget with inst. budget system, overview of Uniform Guidance, and basic cyber security good review of key concepts and documents, good reminders about institutional responsibilities and director responsibilities, good budget review Allowable costs; 2. the need for effective IT controls; 3. Similarities and differences between TRIO programs Allowable/unallowable costs, internal controls, and security Understanding the project, the policies and purpose of the project. Internal Audit, Internal Control, IT Computer risk management &amp; overall details about budgeting, reporting, audit. It was a great overview of many topics. Documentation, Accountability, Organization + Communication How an audit works, why and what is required. Location of documents needed to answer budget questions when they arise. Thorough understanding of payment systems designed for multiple checks along the way. Internal Controls, Authorization controls and IT Conrols I learned about the budget controls and management our program uses It is a lot of information, some of the information is very technical, and to touchinformation for a short period if time compliance, internal controls, and allowable/unallowable cost reporting, allowable costs and guidelines allowable and unallowable costs, the legislative policy of the programs, that Upward Bound is the only project to get T-shirts and a banquet every year The most common IT breaches can be prevented by the user versus IT department. 2) Drawdowns are the primary monitoring system for the TRIO grants. 3) Costs unallowable to each of the TRIO programs.

Responses Some of the presenters read straight from a script - it wasn’t very dynamic or engaging. I wasn’t aware of opportunities to network with fellow trainees if there was any. Quizzes varied regarding what they focused on. On one quiz, I accidentally took it before watching the module and I passed anyway. It happened during the Trio Conference. The lowest mark is because of the online format. On-line format doesn’t really allow for effective networking 6.3 Live webinar 6.3.1 If you participated in the live webinar, how helpful was it to have an opportunity for online participants to connect directly with a speaker? 6.3.2 Is there anything you would suggest that we do differently for the live webinar? Responses I liked the live webinar because it was interactive. Make sure to emphasize time zone. Livelier presenters would like copies of anything shown on the screen (i.e. example of UB spreadsheet that was shown, etc.) Improve VUB webinar &amp; make review courses accessible to people who have already taken course (I would like to visit topics for refresher) "],
